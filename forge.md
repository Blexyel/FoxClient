# Reasons why we won't port FoxClient to Forge
 - Forge makes developing certain features harder ~~(no mixins)~~ update: i found out forge does have mixins
 - Forge is not optimal for client-side mods
 - Fabric and Quilt have better performance than Forge from my experience

**However, there is nothing stopping you from doing it yourself by forking the project,**
**but please do not call it an official port. Make it clear it is unsupported by us.**
